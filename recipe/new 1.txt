Ginger cordial

Ingredients
Makes: just under 2lt of cordial

200g fresh ginger
1.5 litres water
500g granulated white sugar
Juice and zest of two lemons
1tsp citric acid
Method
1. Peel and thinly slice the fresh ginger.

2. Remove the zest from the lemons and squeeze the juice.

3. Add the sliced ginger to a large saucepan and cover with the water. Add the sugar, lemon juice and zest.

4. Boil for around 45 minutes until the ginger is tender and the syrup is sticky but still fairly thin. If it gets too thick, add a little more water.

5. Remove from the heat and stir in the citric acid.

6. Sterilize a jelly bag and place in the stand. If you don’t have a jelly bag then a large sieve or colander lined with a double thickness of muslin or a clean tea towel will work just as well. (Please make sure that they haven’t been recently washed as the taste of detergent and conditioner will come through in the finished cordial.)

7. Carefully tip the juice from the saucepan into the jelly bag and leave to drip through for an hour or so.

8. Decant into sterilised bottles and seal. The finished ginger cordial will keep for up to two months on the shelf. Once opened, it is best stored in the fridge and used within a week or so.
