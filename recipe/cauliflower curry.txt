Cauliflower curry
Optionally rest 1/2 cauliflower (250g) in slightly hot water for a few mins and drain to get rid of bugs
2 tbsp oil, ½ teaspoon cumin seeds and ¼ teaspoon mustard seeds, til they pop, then 1 sprig curry leaves (or a bay leaf) and fry 30s
Add 2 medium finely chopped onions (1¼ cups) and 1 chopped green chili Saute to golden
Add 1 tablespoon ginger garlic (chopped or paste). Saute until the raw smell goes away. 30s
Add ¾ to 1 cup finely chopped tomatoes and ¾ teaspoon salt. Cook until they turn completely mushy.
Add 1 teaspoon garam masala OR Sambar, ¼ teaspoon turmeric, ½ teaspoon coriander powder and ½ to ¾ teaspoon red chili powder saute for a minute or 2.
Add cauliflower and stir fry for about 1 to 2 minutes on a medium high flame. Pour half cup water and mix well. When done cauliflower should be tender yet remain crunchy and not mushy. If there is a lot of water left in the pot, evaporate on a high heat. Taste test and add more salt if needed. Curry is ready at this stage.
Optional – If using coconut milk, then pour it and mix well. Cook for 2 to 3 mins. I used half cup coconut milk.
Garnish cauliflower curry with coriander leaves. Serve with rice or phulka.
