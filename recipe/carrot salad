Carrot salad

As for the vinaigrette. It’s a little tricky. I don’t really have measurements, I go with what I’m used to and taste but can try to estimate those values. 

You need to thinly dice a full shallot onion and keep that aside. In a 500ml jar I probably add a teaspoon of salt and double the amount of black pepper. Be careful with the salt. Start small and add to it if needed. It’s the only element if you put too much it’s hard to catch up with the other ingredients. I then fill the whole bottom of my jar (so basically you can’t see any more glass) of the secret ingredient, Maggie seasoning. Then add a full heap table spoon of Dijon mustard (get the real stuff it makes a difference). Then full 1/4 of the jar with red wine vinegar. Optionally I like to add a few dashes of white vinegar and balsamic vinegar. It’s ok without too. Then top up to 4/5 of the jar with light olive vinegar. Mixing is also an important part. You want the mustard to emulsify with the oil. You want to be folding the ingredients together rather than spinning or mixing. Try to create some thickness with your folding. Then add the shallots onions in the end and mix again. 
You’ll have to experiment with the dosage and season to your tasting. Essentially it must taste very mustardy and acidic. A real kick. It’ll give some real flavour to basic lettuce. I also have a killer lemon dressing for more bitter leaves like endives, kale or radicchio you could try next! Also with the vinaigrette, if it’s too acidic, try adding more oil or maggi. If not thick enough add more mustard. Another trick is to add the oil gradually and fold it as you go. 
Good luck and hope you find your own flavour. No vinaigrette is ever the same between 2 people. That’s the beauty !
