instructions
Line the base of a pot with a generous amount of olive oil, about 2-3mm in depth. Add onion and garlic and lightly fry, stirring, over a medium heat. Throw in a couple of basil leaves.
Once the onion and garlic softens, add the diced tomato, the passata and the salt. Also stir through 1/3 cup of water. Put the lid on and allow to simmer gently on low heat.
After half an hour, give the sauce a stir and taste for balance. If too acidic, add a bit more salt. The sauce should be cooked after 30 to 40 mins (or when the oil rises to the top), but it can be left to simmer gently on low heat for a further 1.5 to 2 hours. The longer it cooks, the richer the flavour (Nonna Maria leaves hers to simmer for approximately 2 hours). If leaving to simmer, take care not to reduce the sauce too much that it burns and ensure you stir occasionally. If doubling the recipe, bear in mind that larger volumes take longer to cook.
Once cooked, if the sauce is still too watery, allow it to simmer gently without the lid on until it has reduced to the desired thickness. Similarly, add a bit more water if the sauce is too thick and requires more cooking time. Stir through a few more basil leaves just before serving.
Cook your pasta in well salted boiling water (a good rule of thumb is to salt the water until it tastes like seawater). When cooked, drain and toss through a few ladles of the sauce â€“ enough to coat all of the pasta well. Serve pasta topped with as much sauce as you prefer. Finish with grated parmesan cheese.
